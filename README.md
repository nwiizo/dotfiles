# 🌿 dotfiles

My personal development environment. Built by hand, maintained over time.

> **⚠️ Warning**: Breaking changes may occur. I'll stop when I get bored.

## 🏡 This Is a Garden

There are two kinds of development environments: the ones given to you, and the ones you grow.

Using someone else's defaults is easy. Everyone installs the same editor with the same extensions, pressing the same keybindings. It might be efficient — but it's fundamentally different from choosing your own tools, sharpening them, and arranging them yourself. Installing something convenient and consuming it is not the same as composing your own environment with your own hands. What stays with you afterward is completely different.

Writing dotfiles means building your own workspace from the ground up. 🛠️

A garden never turns out exactly as planned. What you plant doesn't always grow the way you expect, and sometimes things take root on their own. Dotfiles are the same way. Neovim keymaps settle into muscle memory over years, while AI integration configs get rewritten monthly. Fish abbreviations need time before your fingers learn them, and sometimes — like migrating to Ghostty — you have to tear up the soil entirely. Multiple timelines overlap in a single place, and you can't control all of them at once.

And that's fine. 🌱

A perfectly managed environment is, by definition, someone else's managed environment. It becomes *your* place precisely because it contains parts you can't fully tame. Deciding whether to pull the weeds or let them stay — that's part of tending it with your own hands. What you build up over time like that becomes the foundation of who you are as someone who writes code.

If all you want is efficiency, off-the-shelf is fine. But if you want to leave traces of how you think and how you move your hands — you have no choice but to keep a garden. 🪴

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

```bash
# Fish
exec fish                              # Reload
fish --profile-startup /tmp/fish.prof -c exit  # Profile startup

# Neovim
nvim --startuptime /tmp/nvim.log       # Profile startup
```

```vim
:Lazy sync            " Sync plugins
:Mason                " LSP/tool manager
:checkhealth          " Run diagnostics
:LspInfo              " Check LSP status
```

## 🎨 Customization

```bash
# Fish local config (gitignored)
~/.config/fish/local.fish
```

```lua
-- Add plugins: nvim/lua/plugins/init.lua
-- Add keymaps: nvim/lua/mappings.lua
```
